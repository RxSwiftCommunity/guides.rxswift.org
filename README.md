This website has been built using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).

## Run

First thing to do is to install Hugo, in Mac OS X is simple with brew:

```sh
$ brew install hugo
```

After that clone the repo and run:

```sh
$ hugo server -t rx-swift --watch
```

This command will run a server and watch for changes, the website is then available at `http://127.0.0.1:1313/`.
